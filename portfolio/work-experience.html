<p id="pd-desc"> This project was in collaboration with Let’s Get Together, a non-profit organization. This organization has a collection of animated characters called “True North Friends”. These characters were designed to create awareness to elementary-age children about the importance of having a growth mindset. These characters’ highlight social and physical challenges today’s children experience.  The organization asked the team to create a product for these characters. After thorough analysis, the team decided to create plush toys along with children’s storybooks. Since the time was restrained, the team found suppliers who could create the plush toys and provided the organization with the quotes. Along with that, the team created storyboards for three of the characters. In each book, we made sure to highlight the social challenge the character faced, gave advice on how they should act, included an important Canadian figure and provided tips with dealing with the challenge, along with discussion questions parents can discuss with their children. Finally, the team also provided the organization with a marketing report and strategy. </p>

<h4>My Role:</h4>
<p id="pd-my-role">My role in this project was as a project manager. I managed a team of 5 volunteers. I had to ensure that the team stayed on track with the project and were meeting all the demands of the organization. This project in particular was quite demanding considering the time constraint, thus it was incredibly important that the team was meeting the deadlines. I also assisted with the creation of the storyboards and was the lead in contacting potential suppliers for the plush toys.

<p id="research-desc"> This project was also in collaboration with Let’s Get Together. The organization wanted my team do research into what factors play into the shaping of a parent and child relations. The team spent a lot of time in doing research and documenting findings. They compiled all of the findings into a presentation and created an online webinar for Let’s Get Together. Along with the webinar, the team created an infographic that the organization could potentially handout during events.

<p id="oweek-desc"> This project was targeted to first year students who would be attending the University of Toronto Mississauga. The goal was to plan out and implement a week’s worth of academic and social events for the incoming first years. My job was to ensure that the events planned were creating a welcoming environment to the students where they could find it easier to adapt, but to also provide enough information about the campus and it's services and resources to make sure they are feeling comfortable. A lot of planning went into each event for the week, the logistics, scheduling, staffing, communication etc.

 </p>

<h4>My Role:</h4>
<p id="oweek-my-role">My role consisted of various moving parts. I planned out a social event for the first years. Since this was a large event, a large number of staffing was required. I created training manuals along with training webinars and in-person sessions for all the staff and volunteers that would be working at the event. I also managed 30+ volunteers who would be assisting with the event. This was the first year we also implemented Microsoft Teams as a way to schedule the staff. Thus I was in-charge of managing the system, scheduling, creating instruction manuals and ensuring everyone knew how to use it.

<p id="winterw-desc"> This event was targeted to all incoming students for the Winter semester at the University of Toronto Mississauga. This was the second time this event was happening, and our goal was to make it much larger-scale. Initially, this event took place in one room and was only targeting first years. The team decided we wanted to not only make it campus-wide, but to invite all students who were returning for the semester. This event included various UTM campus partners and academic departments who provided interactions to students through games and activities. The goal was for students to not only refresh their memory about the campus resources provided, but to create a happy atmosphere. We also invited academic departments to advertise their programming’s so that the first years who would be applying to their programs over the next few months can browse what they are interested in.

<h4>My Role:</h4>
<p id="winterw-my-role">My role was taking care of logistics and communications. I was in-charge of contacting all of the third-parties who would be participating during the event. I had to ensure they knew the goal and purpose and well prepared for the day of. I also took care of logistics so creating floor plans and making necessary facility bookings. Finally, I managed a group of 20+ volunteers to assist with the event, create activities and ensure that it runs smoothly.

<div class="column">
<p id="popeyes-desc"> This was my first job. As a general employee I was at the front end of customer service. Over my two years of working there I learned how to adapt to a very fast-paced environment, the ability to multitask and how to work with a team efficiently during busy periods of the day. The most important thing I learned was how to handle my customers who may have had an issue using the “HEART” Method. 

 </p>

<h4>HEART Method:</h4>
<div id="popeyes-my-role">
<p>
H – hear out your customer. </p>
<p>E – Empathize with them.</p>
<p>A – Apologize to them.</p>
<p>R – Respond and try to solve the problem. </p>
<p>T – Thank them for their time. </p>
